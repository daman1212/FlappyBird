This project is a simple Flappy Bird game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML (Game.html) structures the game with a container for the bird, 
score display, and start button, while linking to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files. The CSS (Game.css) styles the game elements, using absolute
positioning for the bird and pillars, and includes a custom font for the score. The JavaScript (Game.js) handles the game logic, including bird movement, 
gravity, pillar generation, collision detection, and score updates. The game begins when the start button is pressed, and the player controls the bird using
the space bar to flap and avoid obstacles. The goal is to pass through as many pillars as possible without colliding or going off-screen.
